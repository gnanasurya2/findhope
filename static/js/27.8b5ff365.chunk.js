This kind of mindlessness is the norm, as the mind tends to spend its time focused on the past, the future, and thinking out what it should have and what if\u2019s.","The study also found that allowing the brain to run on auto-pilot like this can make people unhappy. \\"Awandering mind is an unhappy mind,\\" the researchers said.By becoming more aware of our thoughts, feelings, and body sensations, from moment to moment, we give ourselves the possibility of greater freedom and choice; we do not have to go down the same old \\"mental ruts\\" that may have caused problems in the past The aim of Mindfulness is to increase awareness so that we can respond to situations with choice rather than react automatically.","We do that by practicing to become more aware of where our attention is, and deliberately changing the focus of attention, over and over again."]},{"heading":"Origin of Mindfulness","content":["where does mindfulness come from?","Mindfulness mainly comes from Buddhist meditation.However, mindfulness can be as non-religious or as spiritual as you want it to be.","We can think of mindfulness as comprising of two parts: attention and curiosity.","Attention : We live in a fast-paced world, and there may be many demands competing for our attention. It\u2019s easy to find ourselves somewhere else, such as regretting something that happened in the past or preparing for something in the future. We do this so often that we can completely overlook the little, everyday things in front of us that bring us joy or meaning. Living in the past and the future\u2014living outside of the present\u2014can have a surprising impact on how we think about and understand things that are happening right now."]},{"heading":"Decoding Mindfulness","content":["Curiosity:","We tend to immediately pass judgement on our thoughts, our feelings, and our experiences. A misunderstanding with a friend leads to the thought that they don\u2019t really like us. An uncomfortable physical sensation leads to feelings of frustration or even fear. Think of how easy it is to feel upset when a particular thought or situation comes up. Curiosity means that noticing the thought or situation is happening but not reacting to it. Another aspect to curiosity is approaching different situations with no expectation of how it will make us feel.","For example, if we have to clean our room (and start expecting that it will be boring) we try to start the process without expecting that it will be boring or tiresome, we might miss a different aspect of the task that adds meaning to our day. When we are curious, we are open and genuinely interested in the thought or situation."]},{"heading":"What is not Mindfulness","content":["Mindfulness is not:","Emptying the mind of thoughts or feelings.","Ignoring thoughts, feelings, or experiences.","Forcing yourself to relax or feel a certain way.","Mindfulness is about recognizing and accepting what you feel, whether good or bad."]},{"heading":"Example :","content":["Here\u2019s an example of mindfulness. Pretend that you have a very important deadline coming up at school or at work:","Someone who is just starting to learn about mindfulness might say, \u201cI started to think about that deadline. What if I can\u2019t get everything done? I wish this thought would just go away. I can\u2019t handle this!\u201d They will likely notice many different reactions to these thoughts, too. They might feel tense, upset and maybe feel even a little hopeless. They might find it difficult to concentrate or sleep that night.Someone who regularly practices mindfulness might use their attention skills to recognize the same thought: \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t get everything done?\u201d They might respond by saying, \u201cOh look, it\u2019s that thought.I notice how the thought is making me feel: I can sense my shoulders tensing up and my breath changing. This thought makes me feel a bit overwhelmed at this moment, and that\u2019s okay.\u201d"]},{"heading":"The Improvement","content":["Of course the situation has importance\u2014both people need to meet the same deadline. The difference is in the way our two examples dealt with the situation. The second person was more aware of the thought and how it was making them feel, and could likely use different tools or strategies to help them manage the feeling of being overwhelmed.","What does mindfulness look like?There are a few general features of mindfulness. A mindfulness practice usually includes:Observation and description of things inside and outside of us\u2014without judgementFull participation\u2014we focus all of our attention on the taskFocusing\u2014such as focusing on one particular sensation, like the sensation of the breathCompassion\u2014for ourselves and othersStaying in the present moment, and experiencing the present moment fully"]},{"heading":"Task to try Mindfulness","content":["Bring mindfulness to your meals. Instead of eating in front of the TV or computer, really focus on what you\u2019re eating and enjoy each bite.","Bring mindfulness while you\u2019re getting around. Try to turn off distractions and stay in the present moment sometimes on your commute to school or work, or while walking the dog.","Bring mindfulness into chores. Purposefully focus your attention on what you\u2019re doing. Watch for the different physical sensations and thoughts that come up. What does the soap smell like, feel like, look like? Washing dishes might not seem so dull!","Bring mindfulness into your relationships. If you\u2019re talking with friends and loved ones face-to-face, put away phones or other distractions.Really listen to what they\u2019re saying, and pay attention to how it makes you feel. Enjoy each other\u2019s company without judgement or expectations"]}],"review":"Mindfulness involves attention i.e taking time to become aware of our thoughts, physical sensation and curiosity means not to judge what you are feeling though attention","reviewOption":[{"image":"capsule","title":"Attention"},{"image":"bandAid","title":"Curiosity"}]}')}}]);
