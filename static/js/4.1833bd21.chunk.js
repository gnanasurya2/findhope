Then one of them pass a ball to you and you pass the ball to the third person. After that that person passes ball to second and he passes call to third excluding you. How would you feel? Scientists have stated that this rejection is similar to pain one feels physically when stabbed in chest or stomach. In fact, brain scans show that the very same brain regions get activated when we experience rejection as when we experience physical pain. Rejection also impacts our love life. Many men who murdered their wives accepted that it was out of the feeling of rejection they experienced because of act of infidelity."},{"type":"li","content":"Anger and aggression"},{"type":"p","content":"Rejection often makes us feel anger and angression that urges us to lash out."},{"type":"p","content":"When the rejection subjects of ball tossing experiment were asking to force innocent participants to eat hot sauce, they did it four times more than the non rejected subjects. But the aggression from rejection goes beyond the hot sauce experiment. Stories of injurious and self injurious aggressive behaviours following rejection are frequently in the news. For example, the bullied children who take their own lives. Many disasterous things happen when the psychological wounds from rejection are left unhealed or untreated.

"},{"type":"li","content":"Threatening our need to belong"},{"type":"p","content":"One of the reasons our self esteem is so vulnerable to rejection is that we are wired with a fundamental need to be accepted by others. When our need to belong remains unsatisfied for extended periods of time, either because of the rejections we have experienced or because we lack opportunities to create supportive relationships, it can have a powerful effect on our physical and psychological health. The psychological wounds inflicted by lifelong rejection causes more emotional pain than most people experience in their lifetime."},{"type":"h2","content":"How to treat the psychological wounds rejection inflicts\xa0"},{"type":"p","content":"Many of the rejections we face are significant,\xa0reoccurring\xa0or both.
