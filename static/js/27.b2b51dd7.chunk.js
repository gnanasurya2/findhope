Maybe it\u2019s an overly-judgmental inner voice that constantly points out past mistakes and perceived faults. Or maybe it\u2019s worry about the future and comparison to other people. Such thoughts form a self destructive pattern, commonly known has negative thought pattern and is a driving force of depression and anxiety. It feels automatic, and at a certain level, it does become automatic. But, its never out of our control. Cognitive Restructuring is a simple but powerful technique for identifying and undoing negative thinking patterns like worry and rumination.","Cognitive restructuring is more about controlling your negative inner critic and replacing it with rational thinking. The benefits of this technique are numerous including organized mind aka organized thoughts, less negative emotions, clear thinking, avoid procrastination and be more productive, less worrying, boosts rational thinking, effective stress relief, breaks depression spells,improves communication and relationships etc."]},{"heading":"How to ?","content":["How to do Cognitive Restructuring? Before we jump into the process, it is important to remember that practice and consistency are the virtues which will make you a master at any art, including cognitive restructuring. They are of utmost importance. Below is the step by step process-","Pause Button-","Our typical way of responding to a sudden wave on negative feeling is to act on instinct:","Feel angry \u2192 lash out","Feel anxious \u2192 hide","Feel sad \u2192 have a beer","An alternative is to use sudden, strong emotion as a cue or reminder to \u201chit the pause button\u201d instead. Then, once you\u2019ve briefly paused, ask yourself: What\u2019s going on here? Aka, manage the situation with curiosity rather than your instincts."]},{"heading":"Decoding the cause","content":["Identity what happened aka the Trigger- Be the detective","The next step is to identify what event triggered your response in the first place. It can be in our external environment, for instance someone being rude, passing comments, or it could be internal- our minds- for example, a thought that \\"you\'ll fail\\" during an exam.","To successfully identity the trigger, use who, what, when, where-","*Who is or was present when I got upset?","*What happened ?","Every minute detail you can remember helps.","In above examples, the rude comment or the thought that you\'ll fail*When did I first start feeling upset? Just after the comment was passed or was it before then too? *Where did it happen?"]},{"heading":"Noticing","content":["Notice your automatic thoughts-","Automatic thoughts are our spontaneous, default, initial interpretations of what happens to us, typically taking the form of verbal self-talk or sometimes images and memories.","An automatic thought to someone calling me fat might be, \\"I am ugly, I will always be alone\\". An automatic thought from my mind that I\'ll fail might be followed by \\"you\'ll embarrass yourself\\" etc.","Though they are automatic, might seem unnoticeable as well, awareness is the key. Afterall, if you aren\'t aware of what exists, how will you analyze and restructure it?","Identity your emotional reaction and its intensity-Emotions are driven by the automatic thoughts. That means, first comes the thought, then we feel the emotion. The thought of me being ugly and forever lonely potato will ellicit sadness, anger at the rude person, loneliness and a bit of self hate as well. There\'s mostly a mix of emotion in almost every triggering situation, some being more intense than others. Hence,rating the intensity of emotions on a scale of 1-10 gives a good deal of information to us about us."]},{"heading":"Finding alternatives","content":["Generate alternative thoughts- Come up with alternative thoughts for each of your automatic thoughts. That is, replace \\"I am ugly\\" with \\"She might have had a fight with someone causing her to be in a foul mood. Her harshness is upon herself, not at me\\". Or \\"I will always be alone\\" can be replaced with \\"I am whole in myself right now, in future I will also have a partner\\". Create and come up with as many alternative thoughts as possible, be mentally flexible and practice them consistently.","Re rate the intensity of emotional reaction- After generating multiple (hopefully more realistic) alternative thoughts, return to your emotion(s) you identified in Step 4 and reassess their intensity. Almost always, they will have gone down at least modestly as a function of questioning your automatic thoughts and generating alternative and more realistic ones."]},{"heading":"The Improvement","content":["There are hundreds of cognitive distortions or thinking traps, and you may be dealing with one or many. Almost everyone does this sort of thing on a regular basis. People like to think that they are usually logical decision makers, but unfortunately, this is not generally the case. The way the human brain is wired, it is far easier to make a decision based on feeling than one based on facts. We do not tend to look for facts to support our conclusions; we just accept them because they feel right."]},{"heading":"Helpful Strategies","content":["Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these.","1) Don\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. This doesn\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap.When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind.","Try to separate your thoughts from actual events.Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens:","Situation that made you upset:My friend didn\'t text me back right away.","Thoughts that ran into your mind immediately:She\'s so rude. She doesn\'t like me anymore.","Thinking trap ( Go back to the list and see which trap tells the relation between the situation and your emotions ):","Labeling ,","Mind Reading"]},{"heading":"Helpful Strategies","content":["Lets Challenge this trap-","Examine the evidence- Search for proof if she indeed is a very rude person. Has she been rude to you or others often in past?","If you find nothing solid, then what might be the rational reasons?","Maybe she didn\'t have her phone with her.","Balanced Thoughts: There could be lots of reasons why she didn\u2019t text. Maybe she\'s busy and can\'t check her phone or maybe her battery died.","I\'ll wait until the next time we meet before I jump to any negative conclusions about our friendship.","Helicopter View- Consider yourself as the third person in the room and think like them. Maybe she is in important work ?","Survey Method- Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with speaking on stage and think, \\"Good speakers wouldn\'t have this kind of problem.\\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other friends if they\'ve ever had any problems with their speeches"]},{"heading":"Task to restructure your thoughts","content":["1) Pause without taking immediate action"," ","2) Identify the trigger","3) What are my automatic thoughts and what emotions do I feel because of these thoughts","4) Restructure the thoughts and identify the emotions again"]}],"review":""}')}}]);
