They may eat well, exercise and try to get enough sleep to help maintain wellness. You can take the same approach to mental health. Just as you may work to keep your body physically healthy, you can also work to keep your mind healthy.","But before understanding mental health\u2019s wellness, lets first learn about mental health, what exactly is it ?","Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being.","( That sounds bookish, so let\'s simplify it )","Mental Health is all about how people think ( Cognitive wellbeing), feel ( Emotional Wellbeing), and behave( Behavioral wellbeing)."]},{"heading":"Maintaining Mental health","content":["Just like physical health where sleep, food and exercise are highly connected , meaning disturbing one can affect the rest and hence an overall change in physical wellness. Thoughts have a direct impact on emotions, behaviours and body reactions.","So being aware about the thoughts that run in our minds and exercising mentally to have a healthy thought process (Not necessarily positive thinking) is essential to improve overall mental wellbeing.","Obviously every person\u2019s thought patterns are unique & change with time,so how do we start ?","Thoughts, what are they ? Thoughts are simply our perceptions about reality and have a big influence on your mental health because what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do."]},{"heading":"Maintaining Mental health","content":["A situation doesn\'t directly affect you but your perception of it does. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted, you only focus on the negative aspects\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term.","These wrong interpretations are called Cognitive Distortions or simply put thinking traps.","Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\'re not taking good care of yourself, like when you\'re not eating or sleeping well or having financial trouble or stress etc ( Hence these are called risk factors )."]},{"heading":"Maintaining Mental health","content":["So our aim for the next two days is understanding how to become aware of your thoughts and then manage to control them.","In this respect, we introduce two concepts : Mindfulness- a concept taken out of ancient buddhist meditation that you can use to become aware of your thoughts and Cognitive Restructuring- a western psychology concept that will help you to control your thoughts."]}],"review":"Mental Well being involves two steps: Becoming aware of your thoughts and rectfying negative thinking patterns or cognitive distortions","reviewOption":[{"image":"capsule","title":"Awareness"},{"image":"bandAid","title":"Controlling"}]}')}}]);
