        "I am a normal girl with normal dreams. With some set backs faced in my life I started teaching in jagriti and disha in my 11 th standard where is when I realised Psychology was the correct field for me. Since then the only rule in my life is to never stop but as life is its not always happy, its just like your heartbeat, it fluctuates up and down. But to all those who want a stable life; remember heartbeat is only stable when the person is dead. I remember I prepared for getting into lady shree ram college all my 12th standard, but even after securing a 98% my parents didn't wanted me to leave the city. That time I could have either left my hopes or go with the flow. Today I have been an active NSS group leader from past two years, a debater, a young entrepreneur, a national level painter, and pursuing Bsc h in Psychology, professional diploma in nutrition, advance diploma in counselling and guidance and diploma in NGO management. Still I am always looking for new opportunities and believe in rest not till you reach the motto of my school which I carry with pride."
